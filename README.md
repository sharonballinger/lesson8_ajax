### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
#### 1. What is AJAX?
AJAX stands for **A**synchronous **Ja**vascript And **X**ML. AJAX isn't a technology or a computer programming language but a combination of technologies including HTML for markup, CSS for page styling and DOM accessed with JavaScript for interaction. AJAX is your classic HTTP request to the web server and delivering the JavaScript, HTML and CSS to the web browser whereas with AJAX you are able to make changes to the structure of the web page without reloading the web page by using XML or jQuery on the client side of the web application.

#### 2. What is JSON?
JSON is short for **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **M**odel. More and more websites are using AJAX to power their websites so that websites don't need to reload every time but the content of the webpage renders new data with websites such as Twitter or Facebook etc. You are able to post to someone else's page and the post is automatically updated without the page reloading. Normally you can only load this type of information if it is on the same domain but with JSON the data can be loaded by using `$.ajax()` method to access the data through the original host web server.


#### 3. What is an API?
API stands for **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface. Companies spend millons of dollars on the programming development of their company to make it available to developers feeding information from their websites to yours such as: google, twitter, facebook etc.

These companies like to share this information either for a small fee or for free if their company is recognised on your application software/website. By using an URL containing jQuery parameters you are able to retrieve information stored on another web server and feed this information to yours by using JSON which is fast and realiable.

API's allows developers to create client-side applications and allows multiple threads to run in the background while the main thread is actually excecuting in the foreground.
